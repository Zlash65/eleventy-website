<h1>Simple Static Website using Eleventy and Tailwind CSS</h1>
<p>Tailwind CSS makes it very quick to style web pages. You don’t have to leave your HTML at all. With several utility classes available in Tailwind, there’s no need to think about class names for every single element.</p>
<p>However, the most common complaints devs have with Tailwind CSS is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s hard to look at the huge list of class names in the markup. Especially for simple websites, if we don’t use any frameworks, there’s no way to create components. So, all the markup ends up in a single file and this definitely looks messy!</li>
<li>Complain number two - Without using components, code is repeated - which means - repeating all the utility classes making it less maintainable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now these are the two problems that can be solved using the static site generator - Eleventy along with a templating engine called Nunjucks.</p>
